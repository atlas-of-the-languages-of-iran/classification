comment = The classification of this group, which follows Windfuhr (2009) here, remains unresolved. Specifically, there is a long-standing debate on the classification of Ormuri and ParƒÅchi as either Eastern Iranic or Western Iranic languages (Baart p.c. 2014, Morgenstierne 1926:27-36, Efimov [1986] 2011:3-7, Kieffer 1989:451-453, Lecoq 1989a:247).
