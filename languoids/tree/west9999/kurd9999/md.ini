comment = Windfuhr (2009) places Zāzāki and Gorāni together with Kurdish, as does the Kurdish Academy of Language (2014, 2018), and this decision is currently followed here. Blau (1989), Haig (p.c. 2014)andStilo (p.c. 2014) recognize that there are social connections between speakers of Zāzāki/Gorāni and Kurdish languages, and that there has been a great deal of areal convergence, especially in the lexicon; however, they note that no solid comparativelinguistic evidence has ever been put forward for grouping Zāzāki and Gorāni together with Kurdish. Werner (forthcoming, p.c. 2014) states explicitly that the discussion about whether Zazaki belongs to the “Kurdish languages” is based on political issues and sociolinguistic conceptions. Specifically, he has calculated that a majority of interested scholars claim Zāzāki as a Kurdish variety, but that most of these people are scholars working with Kurmanji; in contrast, he observes that most scholars specializing in Zāzāki view it as a distinct language.1Windfuhr (2009) places Zāzāki and Gorāni together with Kurdish, as does the Kurdish Academy of Language (2014, 2018), and this decision is currently followed here.

Because of this uncertainty, the classification of this group would benefit from further investigation.Both Borjian (p.c. 2014) and Stilo (p.c. 2014) see Zāzāki and Gorāni as closer to Northwestern language groups other than Kurdish–especially Tāti–than to Kurdish.
