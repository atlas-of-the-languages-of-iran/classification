comment = The use and position of the term Tabaroid tentativelyfollows Borjian (2013 and p.c. 2014). Stilo (p.c. 2014) labels this group as Tātoid in consideration of a strong Tāti-like component in the extended lexicon, and places it within the Tātic branch of Northwestern.This group of language varieties follows the southern slopes of the Alborz Mountains and appears to be a language continuum from west (where it may have a Tātic substrate) to east (where it may have a Mazandarani substrate). Alborz varieties are also transitional between Persian to the south, and Caspian languages to the north.25The use and position of the term Tabaroid tentativelyfollows Borjian (2013 and p.c. 2014).
