comment = Windfuhr (2009), presumably based on Lecoq’s (1989c) geographic survey of languages of south-western Iran, places Sivandi in the Southwestern group. However, in that article Lecoq himself asserts that SIvandi likely belongs to the Central Plateau branch of Northwestern (1989c:341); and in an earlier (1991) article on Central Plateau languages, Windfuhr includes Sivandi as a closely related variety.The Ethnologue (2014) has “Northwestern Fārs” as a separate language, but Stilo (p.c. 2014) and Borjian (p.c. 2014) think that the only Northwestern variety in the Fārs language area (Fars Province and neighbouring areas) is Sivandi.71Windfuhr (2009), presumably based on Lecoq’s (1989c) geographic survey of languages of south-western Iran, places Sivandi in the Southwestern group.
