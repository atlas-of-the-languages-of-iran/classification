comment = The internal classification of Central Plateau languages is based on Lecoq (1989b), which uses a primarily geographical classification. The members of the group have been augmented by Stilo (2007),Borjian (p.c. 2014), and Windfuhr (1991). Borjian notes further that there are many (perhaps hundreds) more small language varieties in this group which arebased on toponyms. Izady (p.c. 2014) feels that the term “Rāji” is more appropriate than "Central Plateau" for this whole group (as opposed to limiting the label to a subgroup of the Northeast Central Plateau group, as in this document); specifically, he notes: “the term Rāji/Rāyeji is actually equivalent to Rāzi ‘that of Rāyy/Rhāges (the Central Plateau)’; in fact, people from Hamadān to Yazd use the term Rāyeji for the dialect. Of course, they misunderstand it to mean ‘in common usage’ as in Arabic and Persian.). But some more localized people still call it Rāji.”49The internal classification of Central Plateau languages is based on Lecoq (1989b), which uses a primarily geographical classification.
